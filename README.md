_Introduction to Javascrips OOP_

This is mainly to practice basic Javascript object oriented programming syntax.

Created a ANIMAL model in console. There are two categories: Birds and Pets. You can add animal into any category. Each animal inherits parameters from category (Bird / Pet). Birds has different parameters than Pets.
Then each category inherits methods from main class ANIMAL. 
Mainly to practice inheritance.
